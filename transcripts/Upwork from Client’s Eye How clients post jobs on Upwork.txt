Welcome everyone. Today's lesson we will learn how to apply on a job. So let's see the screen. So as you can see on my screen, we learned in the last lesson that how to search for a job. Once you have a good job that you understand that you will apply it, you could do it and you can be profitable for yourself. So this is how you can do it. As you can see, I have a profile like this. I checked here before that I have checked the history of the client's description rate. How many jobs have you posted? After seeing all the information, I have seen the early rate of this. How much have you already paid for it? If I am more than this, then it can happen. The client is not here. So this is also a factor show that I can see. So as we will click on the apply topic, we will have the option of writing. And here we have the option of applying general profile or main profile. So this is your own image. And if you are a job that is specialized profile, then you are specialized profile. If you are a general, then you are specialized in general. And next, you have a fixed project like this. So you will project it by yourself. The budget of the client is 25 dollars. It is not necessary that you are also with 25 dollars. If you think that this project is 50 dollars or 100 dollars, then you think that you are new. Or you are making your portfolio, then you will understand that you are not with budget, but your portfolio is made. So you are with 25. But if you want to make this project 100 dollars, then you can change it. But for initial finances, our requirements, the budget of the client is with that. You are a profile, then you can increase your pricing. You have to select the duration. This duration is at the number. This is not so much of a difference. But if you are a small job, then you will have 25 dollars, 100 dollars, 500 dollars. That is also less than a month, 1000 dollars. So let's select less than a month. Here we will add a cover letter. We will write a cover letter from our different lessons. But here we write a cover letter. And then if someone is with us, someone is with us, someone is with us. Because we can attach them. We will add them here. And then we will send them. Like we will apply them on the job. We will also see about the boosting. In our next lesson, how can we boost our proposal? How can we cover the cover letter? You can apply it on a job like this. Now we will see another job. This is fixed price. Now we will see a job like this. Which we have another example. Like this. Take an example of this. We need to finance it for their website. I can see a website here. I prefer the client's qualifications. Because our job is also a profile. We are not at 90% of the job. And our rising talent is not the same. So we have two negative warning signs here. Okay. I can't apply the client's job. I can definitely apply. But the client will show that your preferred job is qualifications. So if you are doing a start, If you have negative signs, I will recommend that you apply for jobs. If you apply for jobs, your time is like applying for proposals. And you can also use the connection. So you will avoid that. Let's see. Here we will click on the apply. Just for a demo for proposals. So again, we can select this profile. And we have seen the proposal. So we will see this. We will see this from here. If we talk about this, we will see two connections. So the point is that it depends on the client. How much connection does it require? So let's get back to our proposal. We have our early rate. This is our profile rate. The $30 was already here. But the range of the client is between 30 and 15. So I recommend that you do try in between. If you are starting your financial, then try in between your lower end. So you will try $15 or $18 or $20. So you will try to win the job. You will not be the only one who can increase your early rate. This is the core letter. These are two questions. The client asked the client in his job. As you can see here. Just a minute. This job is here. Just a minute. If we can see it from here. This job has two questions. This question is the answer to the question. You have to write the answer to the question. It is not a subject. If you don't have a subject, the client asks you questions. They don't ask you. If you want to add your attachment to your client, you can add whatever you want. You can add it. Then you have to submit it from here. So this is how you apply your fixed shop to your application. I hope you will apply to your job.
