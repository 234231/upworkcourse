Welcome everyone. Today's lesson we will see how we are able to get job notifications. Let's pause now. We are working and obviously we have to apply for jobs and also work on the job of clients. So you have to do a three-part job through which you have to do a special job. You will get notifications from your job. So for that you can see this screen on the screen. You can also install this screen on your computer. You have to install this screen. If you install this screen, then you will get a Chrome browser. First of all, you have to sign in the first file. You can google it and then you can add your job to your client. I have added this keyword. You can also do a comma separate. You can add your job specification. You need to get more. You can save all of your work on your client. You can also select the file. You need to verify the file. You can also use the location. You will save this file. You will automatically save the file. You will get e-mail updates. You will get relevant jobs from this way. This extension is very useful. Other than that, you can also use an extension. This is refresh time in seconds. Basically, you refresh your screen. This is called easy auto refresh. I will recommend you to use this extension. What benefit is this? When you are looking at the screen, then you get new jobs after every time. You have to refresh it. You can also do this. You can automatically use this timer. We use it for 10 seconds. This timer is running. I am looking at jobs. This is not relevant to me. You can refresh the screen automatically. You can also use new jobs. This is the benefit of this. The jobs are new. People have applied the slip-flans. You can apply it quickly. The proposal will be more open. If the proposal is more open, it will be more open. Hopefully, it will respond back. I hope this will make sense. Thank you.
