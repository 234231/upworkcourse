,Proposal Writing Co. So, first thing we have to do is, you have to go to Google Drive and create a folder where all our templates and proposals will be read. Because, for which we need it, and for this we also need to apply a freelancer in a way that is available in a web developer. So, if the web developer is working on a frontend then it may be that 1 job, which is an HTML relevant, which is an HTML relevant, which is an Angular relevant, so for each one we apply a little on the disk skill, for that we need to apply a little bit different. So the first thing that we will do is, as I have a folder here, so I will create a sub folder, which I will name it, template, okay, here we have templates. So this is a template folder, this is the main root folder. I will create a sheet inside it, okay. I will name this sheet as proposals. Here are templates, and you can call this as root, because your directory is main directory, you can call it root, right? So here you give it a serial number, okay. And then you can call it as link, okay. So I will call it, okay. And here I will give it a row, okay. So this is what we will do, just a little bit, just a little bit. So as you can see on my screen now, okay, this is my serial number, okay. You can call it serial number, you want to remove it, that is totally fine. We will add another column on the left side, okay. We will call it as getch-y-guery, or we will call it as skill, okay. The skill we apply to it, right? So for example, here we have a skill, I will call it as content, okay. Let's say website content, if you write content writer, okay. Just saying, the skills you are doing to your template, depends on yourself, how it will vary, okay. So you give website content, okay. Let's say you have called it email writing, okay. You have then called it blog writing, okay. So you have now downloaded your skills, how many skills you offer, okay. You have created this, then the next part that you will do, you have to come here to the folder of this template, okay. And here, the skill you are doing to make the template, you can go to the template, open a Google document here, create it, okay. And give this document to the name, okay. Sorry, sorry, you know, template, for the skill set, you are making template, I have given it to you, okay. So here we have done template writing, we have done it, but for now, you have clicked the share from here, and you have copied it, and you have copied it, okay. So here you have done the link. So you have now, you have done a template of 10, okay. I will close it here, okay. And now we will write the email writing for the next skill, so I will create a more template of the email writing, Google document, okay. So here, we will give the name of this, okay. So this email writing has been done, and let's do this, okay. So here I have clicked the share, and here I will add the link of the gain, okay. And here I have added this link, okay. So in this way, your multiple skills will come, okay. Whatever your skills will come, okay. You have added 5 and 2, just feel focused, right. And then you have here, you have all the links from here, okay. This link has been copied from the bottom, so you will have to create your own templates here, okay. Similarly, whatever your skills will come, so whenever you are busy, you will have to write proposals, so you don't have to open these templates. You have to open the route, like I have to open. Now you have to open the window, okay. So whenever you are looking at the job, you have to look at your skillset, okay, so you have to apply the job, you will have to apply the skillset of your skillset. You will have to apply website, email, blog, frontend, backend, PHP, wordface, Shopify, whatever your skills will come, you will have to open the template easily, okay. And then you will have to customize it, okay. So this is step 1, which you have to open every single one. You have to make a Google sheet of this route and in one of those templates, the skills of this route, the skills of your skills and the next template will come. Now, this structure, this structure, you have to complete it, the proposals, in the next step, we will go on proposals' steps, that we have not done a proposal writing. So this must be set up for every step. This will benefit you, that as a website content, in the website content, in the Google document of the website content, we will use the links of the portfolio, website content. If we talk about email writing, the link will be on the portfolio, and we will have email writing. So, in this, we will use the amount of the use, which will be used on email writing, as compared to website content writing. Pay for this. Let's say, you know, you have frontend development here, okay. Let's say, we will tell you that this is frontend development. Okay. And the backend development is there, so the bottom part of the frontend, the bottom part of the frontend, or the links that are on the left, or the backend, or the backend. So, this structure must be with you, and whenever you start a BD, or when you start a BD, then this part of the route will always be open on one side. Like you are watching a job, you are watching a skills here. You have seen a job, it opened the frontend, and there is a template. And we will have the template that is required to change the job's perspective, and then we will change it. We will copy it and paste it there. So, we will not write it twice, we will write it once again. And for now, the initial route that is made, then over the period of time, you will be improved from your template. You can say this here, V1, and then next, later on, when we will have, when we will write it, you will feel that we can improve the template from this way. So, you can add a new tab, and make it V2. And then again, make it a new template. So, this is a structure, a structure that we all have, that is required to work on the job. So, I hope this will make sense.
