Welcome everyone, today we will learn how to write a profile description of the app. What are the tips and tricks that I share with you. So let's see on the screen. I have written the description in the start, as soon as I put the placeholder on the screen. Let's suppose you are a freelancer, which gives web development services, or mobile app services. You give services like that, you don't have to write your description. So for that I have the tricks that I will give you, you will go to the talent, you will also search for the services that you are also providing. Let's see, we search SEO. Now we have a lot of people in SEO, obviously there will be nothing, there will be some experience. So we will try to see their bio, their description, the experience that we will go from here to the job success rate. The job success rate has been measured by many jobs. What is their percentage rate? So from here I will be 90% or above all the people that I will be able to make a mistake. I have this first profile, so I will open this first profile. And with this I have the earnings of 40K, 30K, I will open this profile. Now I will show their description, you can make a Google document, and then I will share the description of this top. And then I will share the description of this top. And then I will share the description of this top. And as you have added a lot of things, list of services, keywords, you can also utilize the profile of this top. The description is relevant to you, the job is not relevant to you, you can also remove it. But you do not have to do this, you do not have to do this in your profile. You have to change it on your own. So I hope that the description of this profile is your bio, you will change it, and you will create it. It is not that difficult, you have seen the profiles of different finances, you have not written your profile in your description. It is not that difficult, so I hope this will be clear. Thank you.
