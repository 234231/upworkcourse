Welcome everyone. Today's lesson we will learn how to create a profile in the upper. So to create a profile in the upper, your freezer is pre-requitted that you should have an email address. And on the upper profile, whatever name or address you want to put in the location, you have to put in the true location, the ID card you want to use, let's create a profile in the upper. So first of all, you will write upwork.com. As you will come to the upper, this is their home page. Here you have two options. Login and sign up. So we sign up. Sign up, but this is the question. Join as a client or freelancer. Join as a freelancer. So this second option is select. I am a freelancer and looking for work. I am a freelancer and I am working in the search. I am working in the search. Okay. So we have two options. We will continue with Google or Apple. I am recording this in Macbook. That's why I have the option. So let's see. So if I give you the normal details, and I will use this name here, this is my ID card name. Okay. And then let's say I will give you an email. Which is not my use, but for a while. Okay. If you created a profile before and you will use the same email again, then obviously you will give you the error that this profile already exists. So if you don't want to use your old profile, then you just want to start a new email. Here you can try your password. The password is strong. Here I have a combination of password. Here is the location. So you created it from Pakistan, just in countries, you will select your location from here. If you are from Pakistan, then you will select Pakistan. Okay. And the next part is you will agree with this agreement and click on the creator account. Okay. So just like this account will create, then you will have an email from here, which will also be your email verification. Okay. So let's see what comes next. Okay. So you have to verify your email to proceed. We have to verify our email. So you have this Gmail. This email is from Gmail. So I verify it. To verify this, I will take the inbox and I have an email from the app. To verify it. And I have linked this address to the email verification. I have sent it here. You can open it directly. For verification. So our account is verified. We will redirect our profile to how we create a profile in which niche we have to create a profile. Okay. So we will go to the next process. Okay. So let it load. So here we have a welcome message. And then after that, we have to answer some questions and complete our profile. And then, just like our profile will be complete, we want to buy the services that we apply to the client. So let's click on get started. Here we have some questions. First, we have to ask before. So if you have already done freelancing here then you will select freelancing from here. So I am selecting this third option. If you are new, so you know it's new to me. If you don't have to do it before you do freelancing, you can select this option. So let's suppose I will select this first option. So your biggest goal of freelancing we want to do is to earn my main income to make money on the side. You want to pick up the side. Or to get experience. So I can build a full full, your profile will be a profile. And through that profile, you can get your full time job. So let's say we select the first options. Now we have some options here. If you see here there are two packages. So this is or we see the jobs of the client or we make our a project catalogs, we make the same gigs like the five-year-old gigs that you will be able to start a specific task for you. So let's define it. Basically you call it a gig. So I select this. Along with this option. And this option because on the other hand, I will search for the jobs and create my project catalog. And I will skip this option as a recruiter for this file. So next. Okay. So here you have your information about what is there. You can import through LinkedIn through Zoom or fill out manually. I would highly recommend all of you guys to create your LinkedIn profile that you have a good LinkedIn profile and your professional image. So let's give it a try. We will try to fill out your profile. Let's say you are a copywriter. So you will write a copywriter here. If you are a developer, if you are a SEO who is offering your job, you can write it as a title. So let's say I write full stack web development. So this is my skill, which I will provide. I will provide a full stack web development. So you can do this. I can write it as a mobile developer. I am also a mobile app developer. Okay. Now you have to copy this. I am writing here. This is a test write. You can change it at your experience where you have to add experience. You have to add experience where you have to add experience where you have to add experience. What you have built for your client? You will add experience if you do not have experience then you will select this. If you have already done your client, then you will select it. How will I recommend to add here? You will add your client. So for now, I will go to the education part. Next would be education. Whatever you have done, like if you have done computer science in your bachelor's or copywriting, you have specifically studied your literature if you are a copywriter, you have done your bachelor's or intermediate or metric. Whatever you have done, you will add experience. Next would be language. I will hit that. Next would be language. This is very obvious thing. The language of communication is most of the time 90% English use. You have to select the level of your language. By default, native or bling will select. There is no verification and native or bling will do your job. Next would be skills. I have some suggested skills. I can select the skills that I am using. I can also search here. I am developing. I want to see the full stack development side. I have options. I can also search here. If you have a full stack you will search. You can get that as well. The web development is already already. Here we have different services which we can offer. Here we have to add 15 skills. Let's say WordPress comes. I have added WordPress. I have added Shopify knowledge. I have added that knowledge. You will complete your skills from this point on. Then your bio will be available. You have to have your bio-added experience and you have a simple bio-video which I will copy here. But in your case you can also represent your own. Next would be your main services. We are suggesting that these are our two main services which we have already selected. You can select your main services if you are in IT networking. You can select your own services what you want to be hiring. You can actively ask, by signing at events,出 Harred immediately. This is my story what we then ھاں پہنے مارکٹ میں باکی فیلنسرس کو بیچک کرنا ہے کہ ان کی ھا پروفائل کیتکس لیوڑ پہ ہیں اور ان کی ریٹس کیا ہے تو آپ کی ھاں پروفائل کی ریٹ کچھ میں چھوڑے چاہیں چاہیں چاہیں اچھا ابی جیسے یہاں پہ یہاں پہ ایک پورہ انہوں نے گراف کے thin بیشو کیا ہے کہ کسیرا سے وہ ان کی پیمٹسٹم کام کرتی ہے کہ نیشری 20% چار جو گا دن 10% اور 5% so let's say an a quab developer ke liye ہم لوگ 30$ پر آرکہ یہاں پہ ہم لوگہ لکھ دیتے ہیں so 30% up for clear and 24$ جو ہے وہ میرے کاؤٹ میں آگے. So the next would be this is the last step in which you have to upload a picture, a picture, a picture وقت یہ لازمی خال رکیں کہ آپ کا بالکل فرن فیسنگ ہو آپ کا فیسنظر ہے اور it would be good ki aq aq smiling face picture hai so that client usp is aad abstracto hote hai like in the sense of go professionally mjou ni shai ye.
