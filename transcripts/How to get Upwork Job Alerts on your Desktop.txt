Welcome everyone, All's lesson we will see in the next lesson that we can create our agency So let's see on the screen So as you can see on my screen I would go to my settings I am in my profile settings and here you can see the contact info I clicked on the contact info So here I can create additional accounts In additional accounts I can create two kinds of accounts One is a client account So it is a client account and the other is a client account So if I want to hire a different agency for my own work I have a job I have submitted a proposal I have a contract I don't want to hire a different agency and submit that work So I can create a client account and then I can hire a different agency So this is the client account that we can create from here But if we talk about the agency account So this is the account of the agency We click on the new agency account Then we have a new interface So we give it to the agency X, Y, Z This is the name of the agency Then you have two options Here you have all the options You have a per show You have a connect sign and then you have a team member and so on and so forth So continue with basic This is your agency Welcome to up to up to X, Y, Z You can edit this profile The individual profile This is the agency profile You can edit it You can add a banner here You can change the name You can change the image You can adjust the rates You can choose the size You have many members You have many members You can edit your members You have found You have a client focus You have language, work history So I have created this So I am already showing you You can also invite the members here in your agency To invite you here You have to take the agency to get it You will not get the subscription You can take the subscription from your membership You can pay and you can go to membership and then you can add your team members to your agency So on this way you can edit the agency You have to do more to promote your agency I am showing you the agency profile When you are making the agency You apply it So if you have a submission then you have a show You have to apply with the agency I am a member of my own agency I am a Khodizhab If I apply Khodizhab then I will have to do it Obviously I don't have a connection I will have to purchase a connection to apply it But you switch to transfer to your individual members You apply to your jobs to be an agency member So I hope this will be helpful Thank you
