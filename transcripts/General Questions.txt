I am not repeating myself. I am not repeating myself. I am not repeating myself. I am not repeating myself. So, let's start with the profile first. And then, I will see general queries. So, let's see on the screen. Okay. So, I have this first profile. Farhan, Sahil, Sahab ki. So, let's have a look. Okay. Just a minute. Okay. Okay. So, now, as you can see, this Farhan Sahil's profile is now private. It is said that when you create a profile, So, you are not active on it. You are not proposing submissions. There is no activity. That is why, you are providing your profile. You are providing it in two ways. You are doing it here. So, you have added profile from here. Okay. You can also publish it there. Private Percursors only and public. And, would recommend it to you. So, you can public it. If you have no option to public it, then, it is not the reason that you have not applied on your proposals. So, you are doing it here. You apply it on two-charges. You apply it on the activity platform. You will be able to public it again. And, when your profile is public, then, I am giving you the other profile feedback. You will match it with your profile. But, initially, one thing that I am seeing is that, the head is not straight. You can rotate this picture a little bit. And, you are going to have a straight edge here. But, everything is looking good here. So, let's go to where is the next profile. And, you are my host of Hamza. Thank you so much, Hamza. And, many, many conglutations, bro. I am giving this to everyone, that you know, who is investing here, here, at our time, and that, obviously, serious in your life, is the next big one. So, I wish you the very best of luck, bro. And, now, we still have to go further. Okay. So, let's see. Ahmed Subhani's review. Okay. Okay. You have sent 30 proposals, but not even a single message. You have not sent it. Okay. So, two steps, we have used in every place. Two steps. What was the first step? Profile optimization. The second step is to cover letters and job searching. The third step is to, you know, to measure the version. Now, as you said, I have applied 30 proposals, but I have not applied one. So, we will find out what the reason is. So, I feel that, now, your step is not complete. Step 1, if you are not complete, so, you know, you can also review in step 2, you can see proposals, you can see the letter, but the first step is your missing. So, we will not fix it until we go to the second step. You know, it will not be a problem. So, if I talk about your profile here, then your picture, you know, this is not a big picture, it should be your face picture, because it is already very small. So, change one to one picture. I had already told you in the previous review, you know, you can see the difference between your profile and your missing. You should have a bright color. As you can see, I am using bright color. So, what happens is, on the client's end, the other freelancers apply, they have a real picture, like, there will be some black background, some grey background, so, when your bright background is there, then automatically, you will attract the eyes, and that will focus on your profile, your cover letter, so, that's why I am saying that I will change all the pictures. So, one of them is changing the profile picture. And, the other one, you should focus on your titles, what else can you give in your financial uncertainty? Like, specifically, what a role it can be. It has to work on it. And, the way I told you in the description, that you have already had the best, the best of your top 4 skills, the best of your top 5 skills, the best of your top 5 skills, the best of your top 5 skills, so that you don't have to read all these lines. If you want to see quickly, or if you want to see the summary of this, then define these 4 lines in your skills. And, the tags that you will help in watching the lines, read them, and then, you can use any tag in any description. So, you can do your description. This is how you make your profile, but, in this profile, you can use any pictures, you can use the kanma, some good, attractive images, you can use them. Similarly, you can match your skills, the tags that you will check, and some more profile. Similarly, I told you that, you should have 4 project catalogs. In this, I am always repeating the project catalogs. So, if you look at this, have a look at this, this client. This is a project catalog, and, as I had to make a collater, then, I have given this code. If you look at this, you can see the development and IT consultation. So, this is a project catalog, it is a client. Similarly, if we talk about the heel, the heel, sorry, this is also a project catalog, which is a project catalog, and it has been created. So, you can take this project catalog, and create it, and it is very important to create it. So, every person has 4 project catalogs. You can also increase it. You can make it 8-10-10-20, you can make it 20-20, you can do it more. And, in other words, you have to do a natively-blangable here. You can also use Urdu here. So, my feedback on your profile, you can implement this, then, you can also do a profile, and add the portfolio. So, some freelancers ask me, we are also just launching, so, we don't have any portfolio that we are adding here. You can basically do this, with your friends and family, whatever you know, you are doing, using their portfolio, like you have your portfolio, then, you can add your portfolio, and, the one that you have used, you can also do a profile, with their permission. I hope, you will make sense of this. So, I am going to go to the next profile. Okay. Okay, so, next profile, another thing, you can see, this location, you can attach it with major cities. Like, you can talk to Islam, you can also do something, you can also find out, that there is a bigger place in Pakistan. Islam is a big place. It doesn't matter, but still, it doesn't matter, because, it doesn't matter, because, your profile is looking good, maybe, you can do a cap, like, initial caps, if you talk about consistency, then, you will check the client, you will see, that you have identified, you know, eye capital, design, decapital, but, stack, a small queue, so, this is the icon, you can see, the icon is not so good, you can share your profile, try to use it in any two, it will be much more looking better, we will use the icon of the icon of the 6th color, the issue is, the clients don't know that these icons are not available, or, they have utilized it, if you use it, you can use it, it's a description, it's a portfolio, you can mix your catalog, your profile picture is good, you have done it well, you can capitalize, and then, every specialized profile, you know, you can add 4 of your top successes and skills, you can add it, you can add Punjabi, and you can add it in two things, and English native and bilingual, and, in education, it's fine, I think it's looking good, you know, you can use it, and then, you can review it, and, you can see the tags, like, the poster, like, the one that you do before, you move it, the ones that are more advanced, so, the other one, the tags, the tags, the tags, the tags, the tags, the tags, the tags, the tags, the tags, the tags, the tags, the tags, the tags, the tags, the tags, the tags tend to JUorno- одном part, which gives your legsүҘрicked and the problema fixed in AFG if everyone is using it because your Braun takes this trick on your technical skill bhi niye. اس uthbetar hai old wali thike. ki at least sos ki wo profile and cheese amriting system elistik to hai na.
