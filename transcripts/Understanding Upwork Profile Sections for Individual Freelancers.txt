Welcome everyone, today's lesson we will learn how to create a profile. So to create a profile, you have to create a pre-requisted email address. And on your profile, you have to add the name and address, the location, the name of your ID card. Let's create a profile and show it. First of all, you will find upforg.com. As you will see, you will find upforg.com.com. You have two options, login and sign up. So let's sign up. Sign up, but ask us, join as a client or freelancer. We have to join as a freelancer. So we have to select the second option, I am a freelancer and looking for work. I am a freelancer and I am looking for work in the process. So we have two options. We will continue with Google or Apple. I am recording this from Macbook, so I have an option. So let's see, we will do our normal procedure. So if I give my normal details, and the name I will use here, this should be ID card name. And then let's say I will give an email, which is not my use, but for the cover. So if you created a profile before and you will use the same email again, then you will see that this profile already exists. If you do not want to use your old profile, then you can use a new email. You can try to pass it on your password. Here I have a combination of password. So you have created a location from Pakistan, which is in countries. You can select your location from Pakistan. And the next part is, you will click on the creator account with this agreement. So as soon as you create this account, you will have an email from the top, which will also be your email verification. So let's see what comes next. Okay. So you have to verify your email to proceed. So you have this email, so I verify it. To verify this, I will show you the inbox. And I have an email from UpforGitr. I have a link to the email verification. I have opened the link of the email verification. I have already checked the link. I have already checked the link. Now we will redirect our profile to the profile of the client. So we will go to the next process. So let it load. We have a welcome message here. And then after that, we have to answer some questions and complete our profile. And then as our profile is complete, we want to buy the client on the services. We can apply it on it. So let's click on get started. We have some questions here. First, we have to launch a freelancing. So if you have already done a freelancing here, then you will select a freelancing. So I have to select this third option. If you are new, then you know it's new to me. If you haven't done a freelancing before, then you can select this option. So let's suppose I select this first option. So your biggest goal of freelancing is to make your main income to make money on the side. You want to pick up the side. Or to get experience so I can build a profile of your entire client. And through your full time job through the profile of your entire client. So let's select the first options. Now we have some options here. If you see here, there are two packages. This is the one. Either we see the jobs of the client itself or we make our own project catalogs. Or we make our own gigs. So there are no gigs on the side. So you can choose a specific task for you to define your own amount. So you basically call it a gig. So I select this option along with this option. And this option is also for both sides. I will search for the same jobs. And I will create my own project catalog. And I will skip this option as a recruiter. I will skip this file for now. So next. Okay. So here you have your own information. You can import through LinkedIn through the app. You can resume through the app. You can also fill out manually. I would highly recommend all of you guys to create your LinkedIn profile. You have a good LinkedIn profile. You can also use your professional image. So let's give it a try. We will try to fill out manually. So here we have our own profile title. Let's say you are a copywriter. So you will write a copywriter here. If you are a developer, if you are a SEO person, which you are offering, you can write it as a title. So let's say I write a full stack web development. So this is my skill. The one I will provide. I will provide a full stack web development. So you cannot necessarily do one thing. I can write with this. I am also a developer. Mobile app developer. Okay. Now you have to copy it. I am writing here. This is a test. You can change it on your own. Add your experience. I will hit next. Here you have to add experience. If you have worked with a client, then you will add experience. Like what you have built for your client. You will add experience. So if you do not have experience, then you will add experience. If you have worked with a client, then you will expect it. Now I highly recommend you to add experience. You will add experience in your client. So if I will go to the education part, next would be education. If you have computer science, you have copywriting, you have read your literature. If you have copywriter, you have done bachelor's, you have done intermediate, you have done math, you have done background studies, you have added it. So the next would be language. So I will hit that. Next would be language. So this is very obvious thing. The language of communication is most of the time. 90% English is used. So here you have to select the level of your language. You have to select by default, or by blingable. So there is no verification like the upper part. But if you will do blingable, then your number of jobs is more than that. Next would be skills. So I have some suggested skills. I can search here too. I can remove skills. I am a developer. I want to see full stack development site. So I have all the options here. All the options are relevant to me. You can search here too. If you search here, you could get that as well. The web development is already here. Like here we have different services. Which we can offer. Here we have to add maximum 15 skills. So let's say I have WordPress. So I have added WordPress. I have knowledge about Shopify. So I have added it. You will complete your full skills. Then your bio will come. You have to do your bio-added. You have experienced your work. You have a simple bio-video. I will copy it here. But in your case, your bio is to be used. You can represent your own. Okay. Next would be your main services. We are suggesting that these are our two main services. Which we have already selected. You can use it as your main services. If you are in IT and networking. Or you are in mobile apps. Whatever your service is, you can select that. If you want to give some customer service. You want to give admin support. If you want to give some service to your design. You want to make branding logos. You will select that. Next. This is important. You have to set your own rate. You have to set your own rate. Or you have to keep in mind that your competitor is there. There is no problem here. Whatever you want to set your rate is fine. But over the period of time. You have to check the other freelancers. What are their profiles? What are their rates? What are their profiles? From smart sources they have completed through several graphs. There was only onehow. They carry 20% India. Then customers live from below this age. The address of family, or any country. For this purpose, let's say, you start your easy task. All娘s, پڑھے ہیں کہ یہاں پیسلامہ بعد پھگیستان جی آ رہی ہے اس کا یہ میں لد سے میں پوستل کورٹ دییا اور یہ میں نے ایک νوبر دییا اس میں لیکے کے. So اہاں پے میں یہ پر فائل پکچس لیک کر نہیں ہے. So آپ کو یہاں پے ایک پکچورٹ کر نہیں ہے. So let's say میں ایوالی پیکچورٹ کر دیتاں. So this is an example. یہ ImageManet بنائی تی اس کے Benet background to remove کر دیا an xx smiling professional ImageManet to add کر دی okay. So, here they have guidelines, we have a clear and clear whole face and everything should be visible. So, this is the last step that we were doing for creation our profile. And then obviously, we will score the period of time on the other hand, the profiles of the other influencers could see and we can edit our profile by now. So, before you submit your profile, you must check this profile, verify the details and the details and the skills you have added are necessary. Just to make sure before clicking this button, before you submit your work experience is added, education history is added, the skills and the 15 skills are selected here. Your only rate is added here. Here, your about is less than your 10 lines at least. It should be more than your own. What can you write about this? You can write that you are a bank, what services you provide, what kind of work you have done on your own and what other clients you can help you with. So, attractive bio would help. Because this is the team's review. If this is not good, then your profile is more than your rejection. So, make sure your image is on the top of your top. So, this is how it works. And the next part would be you will submit this profile here. So, that's submitted. So, as soon as you submit it, you will have a step to browse jobs. So, this is the next part that will be looking at. I hope this profile creation will be clear to you. But still, as you have created this profile, I have created this profile which means that I have not had the complete need of the education, you can also record your profile in the video introduction. Make a video of 2 minutes in which you talk about your skills. When you apply for a job, you cannot see your entire profile just very briefly. You can also hire that person. So, good thing. Apart from that, you can set up certificates. You have given the certificate to learn a course on your URM. It is a list of certificates available in the app. You can add it. You have given the experience that you have attended or you have participated in a seminar. You have done a lot of work. You can add whatever you like. This task is done. But this task is remaining. As soon as we complete this task, we will have 100% a client will be interested. So, I hope this will be the method of the profile creation. I am giving you a bonus tip. When you are in this part, you have to click on the talent on the job. As you will be on the top of this, I will write it here. Full stack developer. As I am coming to you. As I have written this full stack developer. I have seen the profiles of the freelancers and I can set the profiles as I have a special profile. They have done 100K. And with 100K they have all the rate 25. I am looking at my initial profile. I am not operating right now. I am not able to arrange it. I am not able to arrange it. So, I am $30. I am charging right now. It can be difficult. So, I will start with the thoughts. I can see what is their title. What is written in their mind. What is their portfolio? What is their portfolio? Their skills. I can add the profiles of the skills in my profile. Your plagiarism will not come. But you can learn from there that the rest of the top finances they have written. And this is not only about the full stack development. If you are SEO, you can search here as well. You can see their profiles and see their profiles and optimize their profiles. So, here, I have done 5 jobs with total listening. I have worked here. I can add the tags in my profile to add the skills. If you are a SEO person and you are a copywriter so you can see the copywriter as well. You just copy writing for articles. So, you can see their profiles and learn how they have shown their profiles and improve their profiles. You can see how they have shown their profiles and see their profiles and see their profiles. And see their profiles and use their profiles. So, I hope this is the part of the Upforic Profile creation part.
