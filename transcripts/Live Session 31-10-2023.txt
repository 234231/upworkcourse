Thank you so much everyone for joining. We will have a live session, which will take a day and I will try to help you guys as much as possible. So let's see, we are going to wait for like maybe 10 to 15 minutes more maximum. So until then I am on your chat and then one by one hand raise me all the time. If you have a profile review, question or overall we will discuss it all. But for now, we wait for 5 to 10 minutes so that everyone join. And these recordings are on the list of the elements. Again, it will be extended from there to available. So, I am also developing the profile. Last time, you have not had any suggestions, you just have to do so. So, first of all, it is a profile. And then after that, we have cover letters and then after that, your reach. Now if we try to take it a little bit technically, then what is it called? Now see, we have got a job, a good job, a good job in front of us. Now, see, when you are talking about the actual client, not the review, not the proposal, not the issue of it. Now, a good job is first, first job is coming. You have waited, a good job is coming. Now, you have started writing the proposal. Now, when you wrote the proposal, then the proposal is also fine. Now, you have sent it. Now, when you send it to the client, then the proposal is connected to you. Okay, that is the paid. Now, the paid connection is on the client, the proposal is being read, the profile is being read. So, this is what it is, this is the new in this field. And I want to make an experience. So, it is not the proposal to take the job or to sit on the job or to sit on the job. Because your profile is new. If your profile is optimized on this level, the client who is applying this platform can be new on this platform. Some new profiles are definitely fine. The new platform is new on this platform, but it is not the profile of this. Now, you optimize it. Okay, now, what is my goal of optimizing it? I have explained briefly how your profile should not be picked. Your description, your specialized profile, your project catalogs, you have to complete, add portfolio, setifications, and experience. Now, you will have a general question. Sir, if we have, we are starting with zero, then we do not have portfolio. So, what do we do with portfolio? Okay, now, let me explain to you, if you talk about the local jobs, then what is in the local market? Is it possible to say that you should be able to make an experience for the job? And after you, you do not have experience, then it is possible to say that you are not able to make an experience for the job. So, you will have a wide range of experience. And, and experience is there, that you have a job. Okay, so, in this case, you cannot take a job in the local market. Why not? Because you do not have experience. So, you can make a 2-3-3-2 job. One, or you provide free services to someone, someone provides free services to someone, they will say that I can do something for you. If you cannot convince someone in a free way, then you can do it for yourself. Then you will think, how will you convert someone into a paid person? So, first of all, you can do a free job for someone, you can make a portfolio. Secondly, you can use someone's portfolio, just for a, maybe, a month or a month, just for the profile to fill out the places. Use it, and you think that you can make something like this, then use it for their own purposes. And when you have your client, then what you used to use the portfolio for your friends, then you can remove it from there, and then you can add it to your portfolio. Now, the second method, which I am telling you, you can use someone's portfolio. If you can have a friend, someone can be a senior, someone can be a person, which you can take permission, I want to use someone's portfolio, use it, and then use it. And if you want to use someone's portfolio, then you can remove it. So, these two ways, easily, you can do it. Okay, so, this was the mobile, for you, before going to be the client, before submitting the proposal, before the cover letters, you see, it seems like a week or two, it seems like three weeks, there is no problem. The profile is not set at one time, it is one week's work, set it at one time, and then, after that, go to the cover letters, and then go to the BD. Now, the cover letters, now, your profile is fine, and the cover letters, which you also wrote, A.I.E. charity, and generate, and start the mission. So, you are playing the same way, that you have, you are not credible for the CIS, so, before you do credible, look, there are two things, one is credible, and one is credible, so, if you are not credible, then, when you will work, you will know, but at least, you can at least show the credible, you can do it, right? So, follow these, okay? Okay, so, when I follow your profile optimization video, I'm getting profile views, okay, brim, good. So, you know, obviously, I know, when you will optimize your profile, then whatever will be done, makes sense for it, this is a form of a platform, which has been available for 6 years, from the second experience, from the outside, from the outside, from the inside, you will get a single year experience, you know, this will be released, at least, 4-5 years, you can do it like this, so, if you are reading the same, then, you will get a real experience, you will get a second year experience, and you will not get a second year experience, right? So, make sure, thanks for the review, co-volators, review, you will get a short time, we can, sir, you can do a bank account, it has a direct, you can do it, but the conversion rate is very low, and the bank has 3 days in return, so, that's why, the way you rock, when you are in a premium, so, in a premium, you know, instant, within 5 minutes, in a premium, and then, next, you know, 30 minutes, your bank account is the best, okay? Sir, I have called my profile, and I want you to review, sure, you have to do a short time, so, review it, okay? Okay, okay, so, this Zen, you know, screenshot, it's also my case, with a premium, let's see, you have zero zero, my subscription is $30,000, but, you can talk to their sports, talk to their live chat, or, the number of them, contact them, so, you definitely will guide them, okay? The other, questions you have, please hand-race them, project catalog is important, project catalogs, through, I have been in the last three, four months, in a 4-5 client, 4-5 client, it's not much, but, 4-5 client, but, now, this feature has not been so long, so, this platform, this project catalog, you know, it's a scene, it's sure, and, when it's a game, it will be a game, so, you don't have to wait, as soon as possible, okay? So, KG, so, a questioner, I am doing an international client with me, on the outside, I am not doing a client on the outside, so, again, this is the issue, every person is saying, that, I am not doing a client, I am not doing a client, I am not doing a client, so, every person is saying, this is the issue, obviously, I understand, I am coming, so, three things, we are working on, for which, we have explained, in a very different place, so, first, we have to see our profile, okay? There is no point in the profile, there is no picture, it's not like, I am standing in the wedding, I am standing somewhere, there is no one, I have put the bandje in my hand, there is no picture, there is no one, there is no one, there is no one, there is no one, if there is no one, then, then, then, do this. So, after that, then, after that, you see, what services you need to provide, you need to know what services you need to provide, you need to process, you need to maintain that two specialized profiles, now, write those proper descriptions, then, do the proper modules, do the project catalogs, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, I don't get a single person who says that I don't get a client or I don't get a client or a client or a client's response. You have at least a proposal or a profile view, it can't be like that. So I will explain you a little bit about metrics. You know, they will help you to convert to a client's place. I will give you a example of how I can give you. If you think that it's a shop, it's a shop. It's going into every customer. Every customer is not purchasing and it's going to be 10-10. Now it's not purchasing 10-10. It can happen to be like 6-14. 4-14. They are going to move. 6-14. They are asking how this product is, what are the money, whatever. And you know, 2-3-3-3-4-4. It's not necessary that they are going to purchase every product. So if you don't have any money, you don't have to sell it. You don't have to use proper service. So obviously, you have to convince them to create a credibility. You have to find a time. We want those people to reach the client's place. So that they can convince us on that. We can hire them. Now I am going to explain one thing. Note this thing with a big heart. If you want to write a copy of it, then you can write it. So if you are ready, then I will tell you that I need to note this. I am telling you a formula. I need to note this. I need to tell you that you are ready. Okay? Ready? Already? Okay. Perfect. So if you are ready, then please tell this formula. Now you have to see that the first step is that you applied the job. Okay? So if you apply 100 jobs, then how many jobs? I don't know how many jobs I have on my chat. I apply 100 jobs on 100 jobs. So from that point, if your profile is optimized, then how many percent of your people will view your proposal? 22%. How many percent? Do you understand this? If you send 100 jobs to your proposal, then you will view your proposal by 20%. Okay? Now we have 20 people who have viewed our proposal. Do you understand this? It is clear. Okay. When this is clear, then by 20 people, you will reply to 20% people. Now how many percent of your people will be on 20% of your people? How many percent of your people will be on 20% of your people? I will explain it in detail. I will explain all the things in the context. So you will reply to the 4.84. You will reply to the 5 people. Your profiles are not on zero. There is no earnings, nothing. There is nothing. I am not even understanding. Now I am talking about a concept profile, which is zero. The first project that has never been done, there is nothing. It starts from zero. Now you understand what 5 people have done? You will reply to the 5 people. You will be on 22% of your people. So how many percent of your people will be on 22% of your people? How many? 1.1% Okay, 1% will be on 1%. Okay, after 100 messages, now you have to tell me the criteria of the today, 22% and then all the criteria you have given me, this is the worst case scenario. The worst case scenario is that your profile is not optimized, nothing has been done, it is just a profile. You know, you have to look at your own YouTube, how to optimize it, and then you will get a client on the shop. You will get a client on the shop. If you tell me about your proposals, how will you increase your number of clients? You know, you increase because obviously, you have come to the first line. After coming to the first line, your profile credibility has become. Your reviews have come, you have delivered a good work. So, the first 22% of your reviews will also be increased. And your number of messages will also increase. And the number of highers will also increase. Now, I have told you a criteria. Which profile do you want to tell you? For the profile of 0, you are getting worse scenarios. Now, what do we do now? Now, let's understand some examples of this. Now, for example, you are getting a fishing, you have taken a canta, you have taken everything. Okay? You have taken everything, you have taken a fishing, you have taken a canta. If you are asks, you are going to keep theMissy, where are the Poll Streeters? Where you can reach more<|ca|> Or can you take an action set by a few minutes? You will try to reach maximum. You will reach maximum client. Look, one person is going to have a shop. Now, for example, 12 hours a shop opens. 12 hours. I am not talking about consistency. I am talking about consistency. You know, there is something else. I am talking about patience. I am talking about reach. I am talking about the amount of food. One shop, one shop, and another is taking 10-10 minutes. This is said that more than 100 people will buy a low probability of 10 minutes. Tell me, how can I get it? From 100 to 10 minutes. From 100 minutes. Look, you guys watch movies. So, it was a movie, a movie, or something. So, it is said that you had so much confidence that you should have 33 months to go. And you should have 33 months to go. You should have a client in 2 months. You should start a profile of the beginning of the month. You should start a profile of $100-$100-$400. You should start a profile of $100-$400. You should start a profile of $100-$400. Sorry, you should start a client. And you are going to submit a profile of $100-$400-$600. That's it. That's the day. Now, it is not even that you have to submit 100-$100. You start a profile of $100-$100 within a day, and you become 25-$100-$100. You will have a client in 1 month. After that, you have given it a good job. So, the first thing that was the money of the stock connects. Okay? The first thing I am going to talk about is the initial stock connects. Where will you get the money from? The first thing that will be your first client. If you give you $100-$300-$300-$400, your first client's money will come. Okay? The next thing you have to do is to get the money from the client. And you have the money from the client. You have the money for your own job. So, do you have something to explain? Do you have any clear information? Okay, I have not asked anything else. I don't explain anything to you. I have planned a lot of times. And obviously, I wanted all of you guys to join. And I will explain you in Shahzaib. We were talking about the connects. Now, many people are saying this. Now, the chat is really broken. Because I am not reading the message. You are typing, it will not be a problem. When I will say, type the question, type it. Now, focus on some people. Because when I am saying, it is waste. Now, you have to write your language like typing. So, now, send any message. Now, I will talk a lot of things. When I will ask you, I will say, next question, then you ask. Okay? So, you have time. Now, I ask you this question. If we think, now, we have all the sides, Pakistanis, Gorani, or Praksenis. We are saying, this connects. We get 300 connects from the Pintali stroller. Pintali stroller is the Pantali stroller. We get the Pantali stroller from the Pantali stroller. So, we are in the Pantali stroller. Why do we have this platform? It is a mess. It is a mess. Why do we have this platform? Why do we invest in Pantali stroller? Now, I will explain some of the reasons. Now, why do we have this connection on a job? If you know, the platform was good and the basis of the reach is that we do not connect. Then, it is very easy to apply jobs. So, we know that easily. Now, I will come to the point that, we use the connection, we use it. We use it as free. Now, people think, this is the right way. So, I will tell you the reason. Now, you will see the YouTubers. So, in the beginning, we will get the connection from the Pantali stroller. We will get the connection from the Pantali stroller. We will get the views from them. So, if we make this way, we will click on all the financials. And we will say, in the end, why should we watch the last one? We should watch the last one. So, we will talk about the business model. We will talk about the connection. We will talk about the connection from the Pantali stroller. We will talk about the connection from the Pantali stroller. Now, if you look at the job, like you are posted, within 5 minutes, you will get 20-30 minutes. How many percent of the job is submitted? How many percent of the job is submitted? 10 percent, 20 percent, 40 percent, 50 percent, 50 percent is submitted. Right? Let's get started. Okay. If the connection from the Pantali stroller is available, 50 percent of the job is submitted. If the connection is not available, it is not available. You can apply every job you have. You can apply every job. How many percent of the job is submitted? Now, it is between 12 and 16. How many percent of the job is submitted? 400 plus, 500 plus, 600 plus, 600 plus, or let's leave it from the file. Leave it in infinity. For example, total is submitted to the total of 200 proposals. Okay, okay. Now, the 200 proposals are submitted. The client is sitting like this. Now, who is the proposal to read? Who will watch the client? Okay. Now, 1000. Now, see, for a job, to hire a world press. 50 and 50 proposals are not available with the connection. If it is a source of money, now, to read the proposal of 100, the goal of the proposal is to sit down. It is a little bit crazy. I understand. I can never see that. Obviously, the client is happy that the submission is over. It seems that I have posted a lot of good jobs. But the thing is, for logical search. Plat, look, a fiber and up for it. Long time game. Why am I, why am I, making 5, $5, $5, $270, convert. So, Pakistani does scroll. And within last two, two and a half years maximum, I have also been in Dai. Dai is all over. Dai is all over. In Dai, does scroll. It is a platform. Okay. Like, like, just, just, I invite all of you to come. After all, we will play cricket. We will play cricket. And, where you have the no ball, then we will say no ball. Where you have a mercy ball. Whether you come to victory, or you are not a player. You are not out. There is no limit, no rules. If there is nothing to rule, that game can never be played. Similarly, to keep the platforms, to keep them mature. to make a set of rules. If this is not a connection, if this is a connection required, then it is a set of rules. So, if this is a connection, if this is a connection required, then it is a set of rules. I can say that I have a job that I have to do as well. I can't see the client's face. So, if you think that this is not for our benefit, then the first thing is that this is for your benefit. Let's talk about the second thing. You go to the universities, every semester, you are paying 1,000, 1,000, 10,000, 10,000, you are paying 1,000, you are paying 1,000, you are paying 1,000, you are paying 1,000, you are paying 1,000, you are paying 1,000, So let's go back to the topic now. Let's take a look from the start, let's take a look atヤu. So, let's take a look at the question as how does ADS run? Openial ad language is the one, but the reason for that is you can try to run ADS from your current driver to my home network. You can go on a reach, so I can consider the company I am working on this. You will also say that you have a good plan. You have good skills and you will work on it. Do you understand? Yes. So, this recording will be available for you. Now try to understand my words. If we have already left the top of the list, then you will not understand this. Profiles, set up the covenators, submit two proposals. Then I will come to my whatsapp and say, Sir, you told me that we will get a project like this. I will tell you how much I have submitted. I have said 2, 3, 4. I do not get a project from 2.4. 9. Look, there is a paper. If you have a new number, then you can ask for 100. If you want a ET, then you can ask for 100. You should know that if you want 100, you should meet 1. You should meet 1. You can meet 2. You should convert it to your own. And once your profile is running, you start to get good reviews. You have worked hard. And why? You do not believe. How do you not believe? Because if you do not get a project, then you will not get a project. So, you will think that you will get a project through client. If you will put money, then you will not get it. This is also a test cam or something like this. So, it does not make any sense. So, believe me, I am telling you that you believe me. You know, when you start this thing, within the next 6 months, you know, you can get a project from me. You know, you can get a project from inside. Tell me, sir, you told me that you believe me. I will give you feedback. Okay? Now, I will clarify another concern. All the people you are talking about, you all want to get a project review. Okay? You want to get a project review of your individual profile, and review the profile of your individual profile. Whether it is a deal, or a mirror, or a mirror, whatever it is, I want you to review your own profile. If I review another profile, then I don't understand you. Now, I will give you an example of this. Now, as you know, as we all are Muslims, we are not Muslims. Whatever the Prophet has said, we are some people, some people, you know, this is how Islam is spread. How are the rights of their slaves and all that? That is why, we are still being reached. We were going to write about the Quran or the Hadith. Now, if we say that we are Muslims, we will not be able to say that the Prophet will not be able to say that this is how I am going to do. Or I will not accept this. So, the only concept I am going to, I am going to explain about the religion. But I am going to explain the concept of 10 videos of 10-10 videos of YouTube. I have reviewed every individual profile and gave it feedback. Every single generic feedback. How the profile picture is not supposed to be. If you look at the session, you will know that my profile is the world press. You look at your profile and you will think, what is the purpose of this world press? If you think that this profile is the only client, if you are a client, if you apply this profile, you will not be able to hire it. If you think that you are not able to hire it, then how will you hire a client? Do you understand? Do you understand? We are coming to the time of the BD. We are coming to the time of the BD. We are discussing everything. Now, if I give you an example, I want to guide people on such issues, on such issues, which are real issues. I have not discussed it. I have not answered the issues like the deals, the top level, how to close the client, how to negotiate the client. I am asking you, what I am doing. I want to discuss it in this way. You guys still do the same thing. Please review my profile. Please review my profile. I do not have any problem. We have a call. I will give you a review. But, as a way to get this community we do not want to get it. At the end, you will say that we have already been very bad. We will talk about it later. Now, we will see the profile. Let's see. I will give my feedback. And then, we will take it. You all see my screen. If my screen is visible, then I will type it. Yes. Okay. Perfect. So, this is the profile of Rahim. Okay? Now, I will review this profile. You guys have to listen to it a little bit more. Okay? Let's see it more. Now, first of all, let's talk about their profile picture. So, their profile picture is okay. There is no such issue in it. Like, they have a picture of their party. They have a picture of their party. They have a good and professional picture. Which is good. Okay? Perfect. So, the profile picture is okay. So, first of all, you have to see this profile picture. Okay. Now, I will give this profile picture just for one minute. Okay. So, I will tell you the profile picture. I will tell you that you can take a profile picture, take a profile picture, take a profile picture, and tell you why. I do not know Rahim. But, let's see his picture. As a human, I will judge that this is a person's profile picture. Is it really that? Is it really that? Is it really that? Is it really that? Is it silence your mind, just looking great. In fact, this person is looking great. Even the professional is looking great. Yeah. Okay. Okay. You can google as well. Or, professional looking photographs. What they have say about their校? What they have say about their校? Yeah, yourить. and then they have specialized in their own business. Which is good. You have done well. You have selected two things. Now I am here. I have come to the web flow, Shopify, marketing, etc. But what I will do is that the two things that I want to do on the project I can specialize in my own business. Now, as you have asked me I have only one skill. I specialize in how to create a profile of two. For example, you have a copywriting from the side. So, you write in the copywriting. Now, you can also use links to close the chat. I am explaining it to you. Now, look at this. If I have time, I will review it. Now, understand this. We have set the profile picture of the ID card. Location, any location of the US, where you have been written. You have specialized in making a profile. There is one skill. You can copy it. You can also copy the website. You can also call it email or you can also use the name of the web developer. You can also call it CMS developer. You can call it front end developer. Or you can also use it to fill the plugin development. So, you can also create a profile of two specialized profiles. What is the purpose of specializing? What does the purpose of specializing is? A doctor. Maybe, someone else will be in the field. Maybe, in a surgery. Brain may have a diversity field. So, there, Dr. Mbb, after doing all the MBBS, how shop specializes in specific things. So, you just specialize in specializing in the profile. So, your content of your work is Google, Google, Google, Google. To follow this called Google is Google is Google brand. Google is Google planet. You can all work in your wilder work. More care. You canzilla piece. If space is here, then space is here. Now, a person who is hired to you, he has very quickly seen that one person is not understanding this space, whenever he is making a website, then what is he doing there? What is he doing there? Is he understanding? So, this is looking good. Now, why do I tell you? I will explain it in a little bit more in terms of the tagline. I am not doing drawing, I am not doing drawing. Whatever you are doing, do not do. Okay. Okay. So, now, let's look at this thing. If, as Rahim Sahib, you could write that on the website developer, now you think that copy writer or digital marketing, where by the WordPress, P is the capital, this is small. Okay. If you search, you will see this is WordPress, P capital. This way, you can search small things. Okay. And, this is, let's look at developer, developer designer. So, you can call it as a professional website developer, top website or top WordPress developer, and then, you can call it as a front-end, then graphic designer. Okay. We were talking about this as well, this is the word of the professional. This is good. Why is it good? Does a website developer can come as well? WordPress developer can come as well. Graphically, you have differentiated yourself by your tagline, by adding professional keyword, or you can call it expert website developer, senior website developer, or top rated website developer, which, this way, you can also have other ordinary, even today, there are developers on the website or WordPress, whatever, which also have the financials, you can differentiate them from them. Okay. Make sense? So, here, everything is clear. If it is clear, then yes, write it. Okay. Perfect. So, in your tagline, professional, top rated expert, use some keywords in starting. It seems that the real, this real, the real, who wrote the tagline on the web developer, you should have written that I was in his mind that I should have become a senior. If you wrote that senior WordPress developer, it would have been the same, because I am also a senior. Okay. I am also a expert. So, expert or senior, these words are very useful. So, I am going to go ahead and write in your job. I will see in your job. I will write in your case that senior developer required, expert, developer required. So, I am going to talk about that. It is clear? Here. All clear. If it is clear, then yes, type. If that is clear. Okay. Perfect. Awesome. So, this is our tagline. Okay. Now, as we have all the taglines, we have the same kind of CMS, same kind of our own, graphic design, and graphic design. Now, in graphic design, it is a logo designing expert. Now, in this case, we have the expert logo designer, take a designing and designer. Here, developer was going on. And here, you are designing. Designers, designing start. So, what I have to say is that, brother, you should read your profile a little more realistically, I am writing. Now, let me see. I will tell you something. Let me check the consistency. Now, here, WordPress P capital is P small. Here, WordPress P is small. Now, you will say that, everyone wants to say that, we are pure English, or English, or grammar, or grammar, or any, then what we will do. The person who has never worked with you or not, will take these small mistakes, and will reject you on his basis. What will he do? Now, you are a copywriter. And you have taken the spelling mistake in copywriting. So, what will be the client who will give you the project? He will never give you the project. Okay? Okay. Now, after that, the one we have to add, we have to add each specialised profile. And no link is available right now. Brother, no link is available. Now, please tell me in the video that, you are going to see it. I believe that it is beneficial for you. Okay? So, let's see it. We are talking like this. Now, you all are listening to the tentay. You are listening to the tentay. You are not going to copy any of your own profile and copy the link. See, the work that is not available, you are not going to copy the link. So, please look at it. Okay? Recordings will get you. So, please look at the client again. But now, please look at it. Okay? Now, now, as we have written here, now, as you go to a seminar, you will not be able to complete the seminar. My name is 5 years of experience. I belong to this area. I work on HTML, I work on CSS, I work on CSS. I do not talk like this. As you go to a stage, I will tell you that my name is Rahim Dawood. And I have made roughly half a billion dollars on a perk in the last two years. And I am a full stack developer. And I have completed a hundred of projects. I have ten years of experience. So, you know, key points that people who sit down with chairs and listen to it, they will say, this is a big experience. This is a good experience. This is a credible experience. Because you are making your credibility. You know, so, why do we add? We know that if we have a client for 10-15 proposals, then the client will not read everything. Although we want to add, but the client will not read it so much. So, why don't we tell you easily in points? Like, we said, top 10% WordPress development, top 10% this, now, you should add experience in this. 4 years of experience, 5 years experience, 6 years of experience, like this. Okay. Give me, give me like two minutes. Okay. Okay. So, I am back. I am back. Yes. This is the way I told you, you know, just focus here. Now focus here and then we will tell you the next time. Okay. So here you have your own, you have to make your own ability to read a client quickly to make your own ability to read a client quickly. And you have to understand that this is a senior, expert, picture is also good. Specialized profile is also good. And he has represented you so well. Now see, if I want to see how much you experience, how much experience do I have? Tell me, how much time will you find in the comments? How many years of experience? 10 minutes is a lot. 10 minutes, where will you see your client profile? Five years. Okay. So where is the 5 years experience? Look at this. So much. Now look down to find that 5 years experience is good. Right. So we can highlight that 5 years experience is a senior, okay. That's the perspective. Okay. This is the hand you use, you can send your friends to the chat or WhatsApp. Please, take this from here. The person is very bad. Okay. This is what you use. This is what we use. That's why we use the focus of the client. We don't want to focus on the client. We want to focus on the client. We want to focus on the client. We have done something for our key words. Or if the client is interested in a lot of things, then he is not interested in the walk. Website development, website maintenance, comma, resolving, copywriting, copywriting, landing page, whatever, you know, SEO. So SEO is all that stuff. Okay. Now you don't know why you wrote this. Remove it from here. Here at end, a CTH IU, a CTU, call to action. Okay. You have read all the profiles. Everything has been seen. If you like my profile, whatever. Let's have a chat. Okay. And then then we go to portfolio. But for you looking good. I'm a little spacing. You can add. Okay. As soon as you see, the eyes are broken, as long as you are able to read. There is no money. It's a little short. You can make it a beautiful, beautiful. Now, I'll show you my profile. Okay. I'll show you my profile. Okay. My screen is clear. I'm not stopping. There is no issue. I'm not coming. Okay. All clear. Okay. Now, just see what I wrote on the top. Top rated plus top 1%. Obviously, description. Added. Then I gave my induction. I told you a little about the custom development. Then I told you about companies. I did this with companies. Okay. And then I did a CT. Okay. Okay. Okay. So I'm. Now, I'm going to see what we are doing. We will discuss some things. Okay. How will it go on the 95 to 100? Overall, what will happen? How will it go on the 100? Okay. One minute. Okay. So here is the clear. Here. Okay. So here is the clear. Here. Here. Here. Here. Here is the clear. Here is the clear. We have to add a CT. Okay. Right. Obviously, obviously, you want to see the portfolio. It's portfolio. Just see. Now see. Now see. Now see. Abraham's Sahib. He's the same. See. But you see this portfolio. And this portfolio. See. Both of them are feeling different. You call the chat GPT in a way that you can tell the people of the world to get a chance to do a case study. So you have to make a good case study. You will get a good case study. Okay. So, now, if you compare it with it and you have also added me. I have added me. I mean, you don't talk about images. Just let me talk about text. Okay. So, just let me talk about it. Okay. Now you will say, sorry. Okay. Just let me load. Okay. So, your portfolio is more than the portfolio you can add more. So, now this is very important. You all are in this way. Because I am talking about the tags of the skills. This is very important. Because this is your job. It is a specialized profile and a case. Now, if you listen to the focus, then you will be very beneficial. Okay. Now, all of you are in my way. Right. Are you guys here? Okay. Perfect. So, if you use the skills, whatever you will use, then let's say, if you have the focus of the website development, the WordPress, okay. So, you have to come to that top. WordPress development, top, WordPress top, that commerce top, WordPress, that's it. The focus is the first. After that, because if you are looking at the client, then you will see that people are designing. Graphics designing. Adopt Photoshop. You have to hire WordPress. And now, let's go through this. The strong skill is the first one. The second one is the priority-wise second one. And after that, the third one is the priority-wise. So, you have to try to make your top skill first. And then, the priority-wise, the priority-wise, then, you will see that you are ready. Is it clear? Okay. Perfect. So, you have to arrange this perspective. Now, we have project catalogs. Project catalogs can be added to your project. I have 20 project catalogs. You can add them. Just a minute. Now, I have 8 project catalogs on this. You can add less project catalogs. I have totally 10 and you can add these three. So, try at least you can add four or five. So that this screen is covered. And then, sometimes, the client comes from there. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, you have this specialized profile that you have shown me. Specialized profile. You will see it. So, I have told you. Okay. So, we are clear. We have already talked about this image. Specialized profile, tagline, descriptions, portfolio, project catalogs on this. We have talked about this. Okay. So, we have the descriptions. So, you have the very good job there. Perfect. So, we have the employment history. The employment history comes here. You can add details here. If senior web and graphic designer did you see it. Okay. So, you have the profile. I am giving six out of ten of your writing. Why? Because of your small writing. I think you have seen my course. I have seen it. I have seen it. I have seen it. I have seen it. I have seen it. You don't have the profiles. Now, you have all the questions. It's clear that if you don't have the profile. It's clear that you have the profile. Then, you can see what you had done. You Okay. So, I will try to speak with Rahim. Thank you so much for visiting my profile. My name is Abraham and I am from Kratchi. I would love to show you all the projects that are completed. You can add some clients' testimonies to the video clips. You can add them to the video clips. So, just saying. You can do it like that. Okay. You guys are now clearing the profile. You guys are clearing the profile. Do you understand? We will talk about the boosting. You guys will talk about boosting. You know, you can see the subscription of this session. I have taken a lot of sessions. I was thinking about boosting. I was thinking about the boosting. You can clear the profile of your own. Okay. So, if you are clearing the profile, then what do we do? Now, I will invite you all to one by one. You can raise your hand. Ask your questions. I will answer them. I am reading your chat. If you don't have a question, then you can't answer it. You can wait. So, you can raise your hand. And then, obviously, I would invite you guys. Okay. So, we are going to start from Ali Ahmad. Ali Ahmad, you can analyze. How are you? How are you? How are you doing? Do you know? I have a friend. I know. I know. How are you? I am fine. I am fine. I am fine. I am fine. I am fine. I am fine. I am fine. I am fine. I am fine. I am fine. I am fine. Okay. So, basically, you have joined your challenge of one by one. And now, you are on two K. Right? I am on two K. Okay. So, the more you are listening to 75 people. What do you say that you work on this lie? What do you say? It means that you don't think about it. I have a friend. I have a friend. I am going from here. I have no money. You can call me if you need. No, no, no. I can check the money. Okay. So, now, you have a question, Ali. Okay. Okay. And let's say, this is the project. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now, now, you go from here to here. Click on the Give Refund. And this is Clothes declined. Okay. See in details. See. See how much feedback is given here. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Go from here and give Refund. So just go and review it on my profile. That will end with that effect. Because until a contract is over, it will not be done until transaction is done. Till then it will be the effect of the review. And try to do that, that the 5-10 dollar project of the line can easily do that. You can do it. Because even if it is 5-10 dollar, you cannot sit down. Do you understand? Yes, yes. I did not know that we can repand it. Yes. So what is my JSS 86 if I repand it, then why should I do it again? You could do it. The second question is, why not you have a question in your heart? You have the word set of the word set. Yes, we have a question. I have asked you a question. You have the word set of the word set of the line. So the question was, I had an idea that 5-10 dollar is repanded. Yes, I had an idea. I did that for the past few years. You have done it again. Yes. You can do it. Yes. I would go to your profile. Yes. Yes. Yes. You have done it. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. 12 days after that date. Yes. So, the second one is in the process. In the process. I will tell you something about the process. So that we don't think that we will do everything in our life. So, this is the only thing that we do. You go to the stats. If you do some small projects like short term projects, like $100 or $200, then some clients were like, like I give you an example, like I showed you a client, and you showed me a client, which I charged once and a half. Did you see that? I had my voice. So, I charged it once and a half. So, the small projects will be from my heart. For example, these 4 hours, so 4 hours, they will be made like this. These are the 4 hours I charged. So, when small projects are soon closed, then your stats will be low. It will be low. Okay? I have made these. And if you want to keep it, then the person will be in charge of the job. An example is that you are doing this much. They are on top. So, in those cases, you should try to make a long-term client to say that you do not close the contract and if you work in the future, then you can tell me. Do you understand? Yes. Okay. Is there any question for this? Sir, I will say that what he has given, is to remove the review and remove the option. Yes. So, the 3 minutes for the job, my review is I have an negative. I think that in the public's jobs, these 5-2 hours, they will be reviewed. This is the second one. Yes. This will be removed. You can remove the option when you can talk about the top-rate. You can remove the 2 reviews. But now, you don't have to take any tension and you will get the refund. Yes. Okay. Okay. One last thing, when the client is going to get the court interview, that you are going to talk about it, then the interview will be released, will you try to tell or take any sort of trust? Look, I will tell you. I will ask you from now on. You have given the market a lot of money. So, he is selling the 2-3 months. Is that so? Yes. So, what is he saying? He is going to be a big, big or small, I don't know what he is saying. He has done a pitch-ready. Is he saying? Yes. He is going to sell the fake ones in a bus. He is saying, he is a person who gets the right and he is a person who goes through the hard work of a person. Is he saying, he has missed his own line. Is he saying? Yes. I can ask him. I can ask him. Yes. If you ask him, Let's say my cliento, okay. Let's say, you're my cliento. And if you ask me to introduce yourself, then how will I say this? Or your background? So I will say, I have started roughly around 12 years ago. I had a duration. 12 years ago, with the technologies at that time, at that time.net was at the boom. So I started with.net and over the period of time, WordPress was released, Shopify, you know, I had WordPress, so I did that. So that's good. This is such an expert. That WordPress is working on my resume and this is the first thing. Do you understand? Yes. So make your own such things. That my name is Ali. And I have been this into the product, you know, designing industry for the past maybe six years, seven years. And how work with over 20 brands. One of my brand is making roughly around 50, a month, 100, a month to business and a client. That's what this is. That's what the product is. Is it designed to be a big hit? Right. Okay. So, I'll prepare that picture from that way. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, Z. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Nice to see you, bro. Okay. So we have Usman. Usman, Aajou, brother. Hello. Hello. Wally. Hello. Yeah. Hello. Absolutely. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Usman is armed, huh? Usman. Usman Can you hear me? Is Maan, you are not muted? Okay, I have asked you again. I am not muted now. Okay, Maan, you are not muted. Okay? Okay. So, Maan, is there any industry? Look at the search I am telling myself. Amazon PPC Manager. Let's search for it. To see this, it is falling in a category. You can see this R is obviously a skill tag. Right? It's skills and expertise. So, you can search from this perspective. You can search from here too. You can write like Amazon. So, this is your suggestions. Do not do the law. Do not do the law. Okay. Okay. So, you can see the category in which category it is falling. Okay? And the second is to specialize in PPC. So, it is a tool. It is made of a tool. It is also in my body. I will show you its profile. You can see my profile is visible. Right? Okay. Okay. Perfect. So, Tokir. Tokir, yeah. So, this is Amazon PPC. We are doing a lot of things. Look at the top of it. Amazon FBF5, Amazon PPC Virtual. So, it has a campaign management and e-commerce website developed. And in e-commerce, Shopify stores is covering things. And Amazon account management PPC campaign and campaign management. It has a campaign management. What happened in it? Okay. Yes, sir. It makes sense? Yes, sir. Okay. So, this is the thing that I thought about. When I was in the campaign manager or SIE comment development. So, it is a client acquisition. So, it is not a technical recommendation. This profile is your job feed. Okay? Yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. Okay. Now, the second question. Sir, I have a question that I am not a professional. So, we should be able to do VVR. Or we should be able to do V8. We should be able to do BITS. So, you can see that you have seen your friends. So, we will be able to connect them. So, we have to make sure that they do VVR first. So, if you have an image, then we will do V8. Okay. So, if you have a profile, then we will have to review it. I will tell you one thing. Your profile is not optimized. You have to make a 5-10-tallar review of V8. So, which one should you make? Sir, you want me. So, I will tell you one thing about my profile. I will tell you one thing. I will tell you one thing. I will tell you one thing. I will learn a little bit. I will explain a little bit about it. Now, see this profile. How is it profile? Sir, what is the set? You will see the screen screen. So, tell me about the chart. How is the profile set? Look. Two jobs. 319. In progress jobs. Amazon account manager. Product research. Look. Look. Look at this job. It is experiencing. Right? So, but this guy has spent $200. You know, spent $200. Right? Higher case. So, see this. 26 hours. Sir, you are building this. Right? Look, this is a difference. Yeah. Then, uh. What about the graph? I am in a foreign bushes dust or mouse. You know, it is going to be a big curves, right? There it will be. Easily. Yeah. There will be obvious researchers that we wish to tell you that with the filters. There is a saying, whoever, akan? Showing. So, what is the image? What is this? This is the new one. This is a GIF. You can write a GIF. But I am testing it now. If I will test it, I will tell you that I don't want to write a GIF or not. You have already written a GIF before you write a GIF. So, you have already written a GIF. Look, I have always written a GIF. I have to analyze the profile. Look at the GIF profile. If you have submitted the GIF in the same line, you know, it is like this. If your profile is like this, you will see the image of the GIF. So, if you are moving my picture, then who will be the image of the client? I am going to go. If you have credibility, numbers, etc. But if we are going to test it now, we will update the whole community. We will apply it and we will not apply it. Okay. That's the point. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So, we have name next. Okay. So, name is, you are coming. You can unmute yourself. You can do hand-risk one by one. What will happen? Yes. Yes, name. Okay. Then we have Memona. Okay, Memona. Sorry. Memoon. Memoon Farid. Assalam-o-Alaikum, sir. Balaikum, sir. Sir, first of all, I want to ask you, how to make a budget income? You have to apply 100 jobs. But, month. So, those are around 1300 connects. And, one connector around 45 dollars is 300 connect. Around 240 dollars is the month we have to connect. So, sir, is there a way to apply on maximum jobs and save connects? Is there any workaround? Yes, there is. You have to pay your profile to cover letters and you have to pay your time to tell me what time you are going to do. Less than five for a strategy or plan. The ones who have already hired the client, they will sit on their own. The ones who have already started the strategy, right? You will use them. So, you can also be used in 20, like you have applied for the client. You can apply for the profile. Yes. So, look, the one who has killed 100, I have told you about the one who has not done anything. The one who has not done anything, do you understand? I understand. Yes. So, if you are student of my age, and if your profile is not optimized, then obviously, you can write down my ads. We have taken the manager. Okay? And, sir, the second round of timing, you said that you have been meeting with PMC5 AM. So, sir, the time can change or the time is the best. I will tell you. I have a good question. Look, the new question that I have repeated, I will tell you everything will be fine. The good client, now, see, when you talk about US client, when Pakistan has 10% of the time, then how many of the US are still in the US? 10% of the time. 10% of the time. 10% of the time. This is the time. So, the good business is, the goal of the poor is that, they do not do job post at night, and they do all their work every day. So, if you want to attach yourself with a good business, then, who is doing job at the time? Who is doing their job, who will do their job, who will do their day's time. No, they can do their day's time. There is no such thing in the emergency, and the day's time. They will post it at night, and they will make a day's time for Pakistan. Absolutely. So, try to do one thing, try to do your day's time in the same way. Okay? Yes. So, you will get professional clients from the US, long term clients, and your competition will also be less. Because if you will do Pakistani time, then the Pakistani time is the most important. So, every person will be doing that. Submissions will be done. So, your competition will be less. Okay? I understand. Sir, one more question. You asked about your project. So, sir, I am working with the software. There are more contributions to the project. So, the project is a developer. So, the project is applied to the work. Yes, sir. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, we have Abbas. Assalamu alaikum. Hello. First, I want to tell you something about my work. My category is different. I am basically a lawyer by profession. And I am providing legal services like legal drafting and contract reviews, this track, the website, websites related to your legal documents. So, they have, or, this is my category. And last one year, you are almost five years back home. And, you know, I am doing good on five years. Almost. But, the main thing is that I am able to see the work. In that, I am able to see that one of my categories is that in which long term clients are less. So, there is a contract. There is a legal contractor. There is a business sales. There is no such thing. There is no contractor. So, one time, it is the need of that contract. There is a contract that is the need for two or three or four months. So, how do you make a secure with long term client cooperation? And, the second thing is that every order price, my favorite, and every order price is almost $40. But, here, I am seeing that people who have a lot of high-end and high-end prices who provide their services. So, they will take a new profile and, if I have a lot of less my own price, I am going to say that the client will see no quality in my work. And, the second thing is that the last question is that as I have almost 300 plus reviews of my favorite, and if I have a client who is a favorite of my favorite, then I want to show you the reviews. Obviously, you cannot show it directly. There is a way out of this, you can build a portfolio, and then, you can put your reviews or add something to it. So, these are two questions for me. So, the first thing I think is that, the service you are doing in the niche, you are also providing service, first, we have to see that there is no traffic on it, and where is it? So, first of all, think of a contracting that you will need to be able to do it. It is possible that a new company is registered, a new company or a startup is there. So, my thoughts will be much less in the company that will come for this service. And, I will tell you that if I am looking at legal things in the US orχید going back to product, then that position of a company in the US, so request that to me, the international Seraf for me, and you can create your own profile. I don't say that, but you can do it yourself. Now, people in Pakistan are doing a lot of good stuff. I mean, $200,000. I was watching it till now. Yes, we can do this. We can do this. You can sell some of the service here. But you don't have that. You don't have to go to the traffic. You have to go to the service. You have to post it on the app. You can reach it. And you can do it through LinkedIn through direct business. The new register is a portal. The new register is available. I don't have the name, product hunt. You can search for the product hunt platform. You can go to the website, it is live. You can also list the site. You can click on the services you want to get. You can check the service. I could do the copywriting of the service. I could help you out. You can also do some branding for your service. If you have a good level of branding, you can charge it. Thank you so much. We have doubt. One by one. We will have questions in the next video. Now, everything will be fine. Okay. Thank you. Welcome. Welcome. Sir, I am a UX designer. I have five years experience. And this is my job when I started. I started my own business after I started my own business. I was a professional. I was a professional. I was a diamond. I was a good model.

You have just thought that you are hiring a UX. Profile. Think battery. You need a battery. But, full you are not able to handle it. That's all for the ad. You can revisit the cover letters. change the time in terms of the time, drop selections and start and the time is coming. At the end of the day, the last day of the day. To be very honest, like in New Year, first of all, it's so much work that people think that it's a very project. So, at the start of the day, at the start of the day. Okay, I don't know if it's because the boost is up or five. The boost is not up. At the start of the day, at the start of the day, at the start of the day, at the start of the day, at the start of the day. Right here, at the start of the day, at the start of the day, at the start of the day, at the start of the day. Right here, at the start of the day, at the start of the day. Right here, at the start of the day, at the start, at the start of the day, at the start, at the beginning of the day, at the start of the day, at the beginning of the day, at the beginning of the day, at the start of the day, we think it must be good or is somebodyists. on the day, at the beginning, we think it must be good or is someone fucking good person. at the end of the day, we think it is a day. How about you? You have started not at anешka time, I can tell you what I am doing. In that case, whenever you apply, you don't apply for a professional.

It's very positive. I don't say anything like that. Do you understand? Yes. If you are a child, you are crying. You know, the next person said that in response that I was checking it. I was like, I have a face, and you are feeling tired. But, my intention was not to understand. Yes. Okay. Done. Next. Yes. That's totally fine. It's very good. But, always remember. The next client was the client. When the next client comes, he will say that he is giving negative. Like all the clients. Yes. Okay. So, you make sure that you don't do that next time. Sometimes, negative to negative. You can always go positive. The client is always fine. Thank you so much. Okay. We have a brahine. Are you a brahine? Yes. What are you saying? What are you saying?

So, we have Murthu Zasab. Hello. How are you? I have some questions regarding this. I have joined the company for 3-4 months now. But, my digital marketing experience is very good. I have been doing digital marketing for 10 years now. And, locally, my clients used to work in the USM. I used to work in 2.5 dollars a month. I used to work in the manager's office. I am very happy that I got clients on the internet. But, I am very happy that some agencies come here to help me. When they are working, they are working with 4 clients. They are working with me. They are not having clients right now. They are going to interview me. They are going to contact me. They will join me in the meeting. Okay. They will come to the meeting. Okay. They will be able to move on next. Yes. I was just asking what we should do. We should not do it. We should do it. We should do it. We should do it. We should do it. Normally, we should do it.

You are using a connection to reach your client. You are doing the same ads. Yes. You are doing a potential client's project to reach your client. You are doing the same ads to reach the client. You are doing the free. You are doing the free. No, no. You are doing the same. You know, now you are giving the client the same. You are paying for it. It's like an engine. Okay. There is another question. The first question is how long has it been since the beginning? I think after 12. There are some other questions. So basically, the two questions that I have. So, how do we suggest that we stay in the night or in the afternoon? I can do that. My answer is, you have told me that 5 for the day, how do you recommend that? I recommend that. My UAE is not a good experience. My UAE is not a good experience. I think that if someone pays for it, they think that they will buy it for the last month of the year. Okay.

So just to kind of ask all of you, that I was on Instagram live, why are you talking a little bit? I want to say that, you know, if you are on a freelancer, you will be able to do it. But we also have to do something about it. We can also do it on our own. So that we can also do it on our own. When you are not good at it, you are good at it. I went on Instagram live and randomly came to a band. And she said that I am a big background, you know, a lot of people are from backward areas. I am from some village area. And I have joined your course and I am from a particular element. Now I am making 200 dollars for women. And that is my housewife. So, the 200 dollars are made in a village. You are making a school teacher before 30,000 rupees. So, the reason why I am saying that, my overall culture is that, I mean, I am discouraging females. So, try to make a community, support each other. Like, I am not talking about male females. I am just saying that I am a person who needs to be a person. But try to make a few patients, not a few issues. I have a lot of people who are on the internet. I am also a person who is on the internet. I am calling them in the evening. I am also calling them in the evening. So, overall, I am talking about my own health perspective. So, next we have Mohammed Hamza. Yes, Hamza. How do you grow? Hello. Sir, may I ask you a favor? Absolutely. Welcome, sir. Okay. My answer to the question is, I am a village. One thing is that, in progress, you should not leave work. In terms of the plan, almost six months, the plan is dead. And then, you are not answering. So, what is the need to leave work? Close it. Go and go and inquire. Easy, easy. You are the first to finish the plan. Go and message me. It has been a while. We have not discussed it or whatever. And then, if we do not work, we can close this contract. If we do not apply, we can close it after seven days. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I sent you a screenshot. Profile, which was 100% in my age, was only two months ago. Two to three months ago. Then, it went down to 99.98 to 96. And then, it came back to 97 again. So, how do you get it back to 100%? I mean, it has not been so easy from my age. And it was a matter of 20 to 20. You have to keep it from 90 to 100. No, you can keep it. Okay. You should have been able to get it from 90. Okay. 90 to 70. And then, you should have been able to see that 90 to 90 is coming back to 90. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, the third question is, what is the impact that if the client goes away without the review, that there are many clients who are not able to keep the contract. I do not know. Okay.

My question was, I am a software engineer by a professional profession. So, I had to do something to make a concubine. I have worked on it for several years. I also worked on it. I was a little sensitive. So, as a portfolio, I can't share it. So, for that, there is a way. There is something like that. There is no name on it. There is a dummy. There is a name of actual accounts. Okay. I mean, in the portfolio, the project sequence is... Yes. ...in the past, if it is a company name, what is the name? Let's suppose... Let's suppose... Let's suppose... Let's suppose... Let's suppose... You know what you have to do. Like, we have to add it to the entire area. You know? Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay. My birthday party was on duty. I had to add it in the portfolio. I will be back in a second. Okay. We have to take care. Thank you. Okay. Sani, do you have any question? Motion. Okay. Motion, come. Yes, motion. Hello, sir. I am audible. Yes. Okay. I am mumble, Austin Femme, sir. I am a four-year medical student. Currently, is reading mbbs at JSMU Karachi. Okay, sir. I made the account before the year I was born. I was with me. It was already 5-6 thousand dollars. I was earning less. So, when I gave you the session, I was a child, and I was a child, and I was a child, and I was a child. I was a child, and I was a child. So, I gave you the session, and I was a child, and I was a child. And you are a research director. So, you should know that you should pursue some content writing job. So, overall, writing is good. I know that. I was shocked by my childhood. And I have tried my profile twice. Even when I have some free grants, I have a contract, so I have a KT-Connect space. I have a second proposal, which I will offer. The second head was not a content writing job. It was a job of software. There was a 3D major near the RSS, but I couldn't complete it, because I was very new to the OSF. And I opened my client. I was wondering whether I should write it from that time till now, in 4 months, I have a different proposal and sand kit. The truth is, my profile is not like you have written it. I am trying to make it easier. But, as a medical student, my specialty is that I can do medical writing. Very good. I can do a copywriting. I would like to ask you, what should I do to write my niche, what should I broad, what should I target on issues, or should I just fix to the medical content? I am not sure. You can obviously, you can also broad, which is a specialized profile specifically on the content, or on the content, or on the medical one, which is specialized. Two job was optional. All of them cover, and on the medical one, you can broad the content writing, which is also written in the content writing, or blogs, or any other option, or landers or web occupants, or perspectives. So, you can do that. This is a question. Do you think, you should optimize your profile, or on one niche. It's better to be, you know, king of one rather than jack of all. Okay. So, focus on one thing. And from there, you get more clients from that perspective, rather than, you know, second line, next line, rather than, you need to provide, you need to do something more, you need to manage. And you can't grow from that perspective. Sir, another question. Sir, just in fact, I will talk to you about Amal, and in Shala, I will target my niche. I will do medical writing. What do you think, and overall, is this 100-hour rule, that you have to give any skill to 100-hour. So, what do you think, is to flourish your skills, or how to learn, how to combine them, and learn, and maybe, four months. Sir, I will tell you one thing. You stand on the counter. Now listen. Let's say, I give you an example. That's my mobile shop. I will stand on the counter. First, I have kept the phone, and I have kept Nokia 3010. Okay? Okay. No. 33. Now, the customer will say, iPhone 15, I will call it in Pro Max. Which phone is this? I will call it. I have called it, Pro Max 15, and this phone is here. I know that, I have kept it in Pro Max market. One person asked, two person asked, three person asked. Now, you sit on the upper, and see the jobs that you are doing, what kind of interest do you have? Which one is coming from? What kind of interest do you have? You understand the platform, and how you are posting the log job. And you can see that you can do this, or you can't do this. And you can learn from the first 50-60 skills. And try to do two things. It is not necessary that you can close your client's client. Okay? Okay, sir. Do you understand what I am saying? Yes, yes. It is not necessary. No, it is not necessary. You can close the client's client's client's which you can come to. I have made a lot of such clients that I didn't come to. The client made me pay for it. I have learnt and I have implemented it. I have also learnt and learned it. And he also made his money. Okay. Okay. Okay. Sir, this is the answer. Sir, one more thing. Yes, you can say it. Yes. So, the second thing we learn is that we learn a lot of our overall skills in the industry. So, we learn Amazon, SEO, SEO, etc. and we learn it. And we learn it. We don't come to the company on the other side. When you go to the basic side, then what are the things that you don't fix? So, over the period of time, you learn it. You know? Okay. Sir, one last question. I will take all of this. I have seen many videos. So, one person suggested me that you should make your online presence as you have to make your own website. It is a content writer. So, I have not paid. I have made an unpaid website. I have not paid. I have not paid. But I have made a site called 123 for my own website. So, I have made a portfolio for you. So, I want you to know what you need to do with this. What I need to do is to make my own virtual presence more Flare. You need to make your own client and then you will view the client of your own client. Your website or your profile. Your profile is right. You will be able to do it. So, the client has to come to view it. When you will be in the game of LinkedIn, you will be in the email game, you will be a little older. Then you will have to go to your personal branding. Okay. Okay, sir. Thank you so much. Okay, sir. So, I am going to end this. We have been in the Kriban for two hours. Our session has been in the Kriban for two hours. In Shalak Group, the update will be in the WhatsApp when news is being made. We will have to do weekly session. You can follow me on Instagram. Obviously, you know.
