Welcome everyone, I hope you guys are doing great. Today we will discuss a very important topic which is more relevant towards BD. I am very happy to be able to apply for proposals but I am not able to respond. So, the first step is to be very simple and straightforward. The first step is to optimize your profile. The steps and procedures I have told you are to specialize in writing and creating a profile. The other thing is to use the skills of your profile. You don't have to narrow down your skills. You have to keep your job at least at least. So, the first step is to optimize your profile. And then after that, you have to search for jobs. And after searching for jobs, you have to explain the cover letter. The next step is to answer the questions that I am asking you. We are applying for BD but we don't answer. So, try to understand this way that there are 100 customers in a shop. Now, the 100 customers don't do purchasing from there. They don't do all the products. I will explain to the 40% of people who ask about the product. They will do the purchasing of the product. So, I am going to explain this to you. So, try to understand how many jobs you need to take on the month. You need to know how many jobs you need to take on the month. There are no reviews on the profile. First, you don't need to know the benefits of the job. Your profile is a good set. The cover letter is a good set. When you get the second set, you will use the formula. You have to do this to see how many proposals you are applying. How many clients are reaching. How many people are talking to you. How many close-ups will you get. So, just an example. The number of people who are in the middle level is applied to the 100% of the proposals. In a month. From 100 to less than 10, you will talk to them. From that 10, you will have a number of 3 clients. You will start working with them. You will have a job assigned. So, you have seen your conversion. The thing is that we apply on one proposal and wait for it. For example, we apply on one day. Then we leave it and do not expose it. Do not look at it like this. You have to do a daily job on the daily job. You have to apply on the job posting. If you see from its perspective, you will have a 6-poss. You are doing 5 days a week. So, 5 into 6-30. And 30 into 4. Because it is 4 weeks. So, if you apply on a 100% of the proposals, you will close 3-4 clients. When you close 3-4 clients, you will have a stream. So, you will have to go and do a connection with your boss. You will have to apply on BDK and BDK. You will have to hire someone to do a bondage for you. You will have to apply on your jobs. So, you will have to apply on your job. So, this is very important. Look at the conversion rate. Okay, profile set, cover letter fixed. And then, conversion rate is to monitor the conversion rate. Okay, over the period of time, conversion rate will increase. Because, when you start reviewing on your profile, when you will have positive reviews, you will be more trusted. The conversion rate will gradually grow. And with this, keep in mind that when you have to apply on jobs and proposals, then you will have to take 10-10 bg. You will have to do 4-4 bg. You have to do whatever you want. Content, website, WordPress. Whatever you want to do in this time span, then you will have to buy BDK. So, I hope this will be clear. Step 1 profile is your full 100% complete. Your specialized profiles are there. Whatever I have not posted on the previous videos, I have also posted reviews on them. Follow them. And with that, you will have jobs, proposals and cover letters. And then next part is conversion rate. So, I hope you all will be clear. So, let me know if you guys have any questions. Thank you.
