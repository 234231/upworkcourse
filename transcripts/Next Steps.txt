Welcome everyone. Today's lesson we will see what are the tips of the Upvuri which I can share with you. First of all, when you are talking about the time of proposals what kind of proposals you are submitting, then you can get more response. So, from my opinion, if you apply the proposal between 5th and 10th of January, then you will apply the job success which is the response rate or the conversion rate of the client. So, this is tip number 1. The second tip is to try to reach the call with the client. Zoom call, or video call, or audio call. That's totally fine. Try to reach the call with the client. Third point is to improve the skills you have in English. Fourth point is to read the message, read the job, and answer it. When the client's message is sent, you have to answer it in detail. So, I will show you the messages interface. It shows the message interface. Let's see on the screen. So, here you have messages. This is my own individual profile. You can see from here how we have that show here. Just check this as an example. I have submitted a job. If you don't have this example, let's take this as an example. So, I had submitted a job. Then I have the response from this way. Then, with our next client, the discussion was done. This project is the final chapter of the GPDC-Relevant project. We have updated all the articles on WordPress. This is how this interface looks like. And, you have all notifications here. And, you have agencies like this. If you have a profile of your agency, you have this show. If you have a client profile, then it shows the client's money. You switch it from here. And, this is how it all works. And, I wish you the very best of luck with all the job hunting and with your next upwork journey. Thank you.
