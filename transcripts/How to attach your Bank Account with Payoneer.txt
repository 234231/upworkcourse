Welcome everyone. In today's lesson we will learn what is the painier and how we can use the painier to draw on the pymids. When you will do some kind of crime, when you complete the task, then obviously your pymid will be released like the upper. So you have to draw on the upper. So you have two methods to draw on the upper. One method is to add directly to your bank account details in the upper. The details will be added like you will get 3 days in verification. If you will get the details, you can also draw directly in your account. Now, how do we look at painier? Before we look at the painier, we check the bank account details. We check how we can add the painier. As my profile is, I will go to settings. I will come to the settings again. I will go to the password. I will show all the settings here.
