Welcome everyone. In today's lesson we will talk about the pricing of the app. Whether it is a trip or a trip that we can use. We will set up our profile on the pricing set. So let's look at the screen. As you can see, my screen is showing the default pricing that we used before. Before we used the trick we used to look at the description, we will look at the differences of our field and the differences of our differences. They have a price of their profiles. We can set the prices of our own. So this is how we do it. As we clicked on the JOSP and selected the talents. Now we have to search for our own field. I am searching for a wordpress. I have been using the wordpress for a while. I want to see how much the wordpress is being charged. The pricing is now charged with a $150. But it is possible that this US$100% job is successful. It is very old in this platform. If you keep the $150 on the OLED, no one will have a client on your own. If you keep the $150 on the OLED, you will have to go to the client. You have to keep the price of your own. We will use the main thing here. We are in Pakistan. We have to look at the prices of our field. I will add the filter here. Now I have the option to show you the options of the field. As you can see, the initial price is now around $100. It is a $97% job success rate. It has been operated. It has been shown to you for a long time. It has been a badge on its basis. We will discuss briefly about this. The early rate set is about $25. The next is $45. You can see how much they have done. You can see the difference in the early rate of your own. You can see the difference in the early rate set. The average set is about $15. How successful and how successful you are. How much you are at the top of your needs. You can adjust your quality. You can increase your prices. It would be much easier for you.
